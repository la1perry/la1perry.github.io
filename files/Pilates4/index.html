Pilates is used to improve how the body functions by strengthening core muscles, restoring vitality and balance through mindfully executed movement. Activities in our studio include instruction through Mat Classes, or with carefully structured exercises using specially designed equipment such as Reformers, Cadillacs and the Pilates Chair.</p>

Whether you are experiencing back pain, joint issues, chronic fatigue or are healing from a spinal cord injury, working with our instructors will give you the knowledge you need to bring your body back in to alignment.Pilates targets not only specific injury-related conditions, it is also used for general strengthening and toning of the body.

 			<h3><span>Our Method</span></h3>
 <p>Pilates is a low impact methodology of movement that uses stretching and strengthening tehniques formulated to shape a stronger, leaner, and more flexible body. It offers an accessible practice for people of all ages, backgrounds, and fitness levels. It is a gentle, non-invasive form of exercise that combines controlled breathing patterns with precision movements that together help bring the body back into harmony. The goal of Pilates is to improve strength, postural alignment, muscle tone and flexibility. </p>

<p> Sessions working with the Pilates Equipment begin with private 1 hour classes alongside a certified Pilates Practitioner. Your Instructor will help you determine your individual needs to create a safe, achievable, and personalized program. Once you and your instructor agree that you have reached a level of comfortability and agility using the Pilates equipment, you may also choose to attend group sessions. Working with the Reformers ensures rapid results are achieved, and specific attention is paid to develop your form at a pace that suits your needs.</p>

<p>
  Mat Classes achieve the strengthening and toning benefits of Pilates and are taught progressively over a period of 8 to 12 weeks. Classes range from 2-8 people and offer a cost effective way to achieve your fitness goals.</p>

She received her B.A. From the University of Victoria and after graduating began her career working for the West Vancouver Police Department. Lisanne continued to develop her passion in understanding how movement can rehabilitate and restore the body, studying Kinesiology at S.F.U. before deciding to approach the study of Pilates.
